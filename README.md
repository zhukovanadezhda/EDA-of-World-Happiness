While analyzing the World Happiness Report for 2015-2019, I hypothesized that there is a correlation between the economic well-being of a country and the happiness of its population. On the correlation graph, it was noticed that the economic well-being of the country and the level of happiness of its population are very correlated. To develop this hypothesis, it was decided to use linear regression to see how well the happiness schore can be predicted based on the economic well-being of a country. A joint distribution of these values was constructed, and a model was proposed for predicting the Happiness Score based on the level of economic well-being of the country. The value of the standard deviation turned out to be quite small, which indicates that the model works well. 
Finally, all the dataframes were combined into one, with the help of which a list of average places for all years by the level of happiness occupied by each country was created. It turned out that Denmark occupies a leading position.
